/*
  This file is temporary, for FastLED backwards compatibility, as older versions of FastLED require SmartMatrix_h to be defined, and SmartMatrix.h to be present and include the old SmartMatrix class

  In a future release SmartMatrix.h will be renamed to SmartMatrix3.h, and the SmartMatrix_h definition and dummy SmartMatrix class will be removed
