  LIDAR-Lite v2: If second return availble, show instead of strongest signal

  This example will demostrate how to disable showing strongest signal return 
  and print the second return if one is availble. This kind of approach can help
  with window and chain link fence detection situation (amungst others).


  The library is in BETA, so subscribe to the github repo to recieve updates, or
  just check in periodically:
